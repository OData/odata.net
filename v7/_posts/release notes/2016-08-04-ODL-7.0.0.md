category: "4. Release Notes"
---

To briefly summarize the breaking changes, most of them fall into one of four categories:

## Improved Performance ##
We will get better writer performance across the board. 

## Introducing Dependency Injection ##
This feature will substantially increase extensibility, like allowing customers to replace entire components such as the `UriPathParser` with their own implementation. Introducing DI make it much easier to use the same reader/writer settings across the board. 

## Removed Legacy Code ##
There was a lot of vestigial code left around from the OData v1-3 days that we’ve removed. 

## Improved API Design ##
Most of our API improvements fall into the category of namespace simplifications or updating verbiage. The single most impactful change that we made was deciding to merge entity type and complex type in ODataLib. We did this because complex type and entity type are becoming more and more similar in the protocol, but we continue to pay overhead to make things work for both of them.


## Changes in ODataLib 7.0 Release ##

### New Features ###

[[Issue #245](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/245)] Support duplicate non-OData query options.

[[Issue #248](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/248)] Support untyped JSON.

- This feature will allow customers to extend their OData payloads with arbitrary JSON. In the extreme, it’s theoretically possible for the whole response to be untyped.

[[Issue #271](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/271)] Support writing relative URIs in OData batch operations.

- Add an enum type `BatchPayloadUriOption` to support three URI formats in batch payload.

[[Issue #366](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/366)] Support collection of mixed primitive types and Edm.Untyped.

[[Issue #501](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/501)] Integrate dependency injection (DI).

- We introduced an abstraction layer consisting of two interfaces `IContainerBuilder` and `IContainerProvider` so that ODataLib is decoupled from any concrete implementation of DI framework.
Now we support the following services to be replaced by users:

	- JSON reader via `IJsonReaderFactory`
	- JSON writer via `IJsonWriterFactory`
	- `ODataMediaTypeResolver`
	- `ODataPayloadValueConverter`
	- `ODataUriResolver`
	- `UriPathParser`

- We also support prototype services. For each prototype service, you can specify a globally singleton prototype instance. Then for each request, a cloned instance will be created from that prototype which can isolate the modification within the request boundary. Currently we support three prototype services:
	- `ODataMessageReaderSettings`
	- `ODataMessageWriterSettings`
	- `ODataSimplifiedOptions`

[[Issue #502](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/502)] Support URI path syntax customization.

- Expose `UriPathParser.ParsePathIntoSegments` to support customizing how to separate a Uri into segments
- Provide` ParseDynamicPathSegmentFunc` for customizing how to parse a dynamic path segment.

[[Issue #613](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/613)] Support type facets when referencing `TypeDefinition` types.

[[Issue #622](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/622)] [Support navigation property on complex types.](http://odata.github.io/odata.net/v7/#06-18-navigation-under-complex)

- EdmLib supports adding navigation property on complex type in model.
- ODataUriParser support parsing related Uri path or query expressions.
- ODataLib support reading and writing navigation properties on complex type.

[[Issue #629](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/629)] Support multi-NavigationPropertyBindings for a single navigation property by using different paths

- Navigation property used in multi bindings with different path is supported for navigation under containment and complex.

[[Issue #631](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/631)] Support fluent writer API.
- In previous version, paired `WriteStart` and `WriteEnd` calls are used in writing payloads. This syntax is error-prone, and soon gets unmanageable with complex and deeply nested payloads. In this new release, you can instead write payloads using the neat fluent syntax.

[[Issue #635](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/635)] Support collection of nullable values for dynamic properties.

[[Issue #637](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/637)] Support system query options without $ prefix.

- Expose `ODataUriParser.EnableNoDollarQueryOptions` flag to enable user to support '$' system query prefix optional.

Add `ODataSimplifiedOptions` class for simplified reader, writer, URL parsing options.

Support duplicate custom instance annotations. 

## Fixed Bugs ##

[[Issue #104](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/104)] Function imports with parameters are included in service document.

[[Issue #498](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/498)] Typos in namespace/class names.

[[Issue #508](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/508)] YYYY-MM-DD in URI should be parsed into `Date`, not `DataTimeOffset`.

[[Issue #556](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/556)] URI template parser doesn't work correctly if key is of an enum type.

[[Issue #573](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/573)] `CollectionCount` is not publicly accessible.

[[Issue #592](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/592)] `ODataUriParser.ParsePath()` doesn’t work correctly if `EntitySetPath` is not specified in model.

[[Issue #628](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/628)] Dynamic complex (collection) property is annotated with association and navigation links.

[[Issue #638](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/638)] Null value at the first position in a complex collection cannot be read.

[[Issue #658](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/658)] `ODataValueUtils.ToODataValue` doesn’t work with `System.Enum` objects.

## Improvements ##

[[Issue #606](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/606)] Remove V3 vocabulary expressions

[[Issue #618](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/618)] Remove deprecated validation rules

### Public API Simplification ###

[[Issue #504](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/504)] Unify entity and complex (collection) type serialization/deserialization API.

- Merge the reading/writing behavior for complex and entity, collection of complex and collection of entity.
	- Change `ODataEntry` to `ODataResource` and remove `ODataComplexValue` to support complex and entity.
	- Change `ODataFeed` to `ODataResourceSet` to support feed and complex collection.
	- Change `ODataNavigationLink` to `ODataNestedResourceInfo` to support navigation property and complex property or complex collection property.
	- Change reader/writer APIs to support `IEdmStructuredType`.
- We don’t merge entity type/complex type in EdmLib since they are OData concepts.

[[Issue #491](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/491)] Simplified namespaces.

[[Issue #517](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/517)] Centralized reader/writer validation.

- Add an enum `ValidationKinds` to represent all validation kinds in reader and writer.
- Add Validations property in `ODataMessageWriterSettings`/`ODataMessageReaderSettings` to control validations.
- Remove some APIs.

[[Issue #571](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/571)] Rename `ODataUrlConvention` to `ODataUrlKeyDelimiter`

- Rename `ODataUrlConvention` to `ODataUrlKeyDelimiter`.
- Use `ODataUrlKeyDelimiter.Slash` instead of `ODataUrlConvention.Simplified` or `ODataUrlConvention.KeyAsSegment`
- Use `ODataUrlKeyDelimiter.Parentheses` instead of `ODataUrlConvention.Default`

[[Issue #614](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/614)] Improve API design around `ODataAnnotatable`

- Merge `SerializationTypeNameAnnotation` into `ODataTypeAnnotation`
- Refactor `ODataTypeAnnotation` to contain only the type name
- Remove unnecessary inheritance from `ODataAnnotatable` in URI parser and simplify the API of `ODataAnnotatble`
- `GetAnnotation<T>()` and `SetAnnotation<T>()` will no longer be available because `ODataAnnotatable` should only be responsible for managing instance annotations.

### Public API Enhancement ###

[[Issue #484](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/484)] Preference header extensibility

- Public class `HttpHeaderValueElement`, which represents http header value element
- Remove sealed from public class `ODataPreferenceHeader`

[[Issue #544](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/544)] Change Enum member value type from `IEdmPrimitiveValue` to a more specific type.

- Add interface `IEdmEnumMemberValue` and class `EdmEnumMemberValue` to represent enum member value specifically. `AddMember()` under `EnumType` now accepts `IEdmEnumMemberValue` instead of `IEdmPrimitiveValue` as member value. 

[[Issue #621](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/621)] Make reader able to read contained entity/entityset without context URL.
 
[[Issue #640](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/640)] More sensible type, namely IEnumerable<object>, for ODataCollectionValue.Items.

[[Issue #643](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/643)] Adjust query node kinds in Uri Parser in order to support navigation under complex. [[Breaking Changes](http://odata.github.io/odata.net/v7/#04-01-Query-Nodes-Breaking)]
 
Improved standard-compliance by forbidding duplicate property names.

Writer throws more accurate and descriptive exceptions.

### Other Improvements ###

[[Issue #493](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/493)] Replace `ThrowOnUndeclaredProperty` with the more accurate `ThrowOnUndeclaredPropertyForNonOpenType`.

[[Issue #551](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/551)] Change the type of `EdmReference.Uri` to `System.Uri`.

[[Issue #558](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/558), 
[[Issue #611](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/611)] Improve writer performance. Up to 25% improvements compared to ODL 6.15 are achieved depending on scenario.

[[Issue #632](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/632)] Rename CsdlXXX to SchemaXXX, and EdmxXXX to CsdlXXX.

The original naming is confusing. According to the [CSDL spec](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/errata02/os/complete/part3-csdl/odata-v4.0-errata02-os-part3-csdl-complete.html#_Toc406397921):

> An XML document using these namespaces and having an edmx:Edmx root element will be called a CSDL document.

So, Edmx is only part of a valid CSDL document. In previous version, `CsdlReader` is actually unable to read a CSDL document. It's only able to read the Schema part of it. `EdmxReader`, on the other hand, is able to read a whole CSDL document. To clear up the concepts, the following renaming has been done:

1. `CsdlReader/Writer` to `SchemaReader/Writer`;
1. `EdmxReader/Writer` to `CsdlReader/Writer`;
1. `EdmxReaderSettings` to `CsdlReaderSettings`;
1. `EdmxTarget` to `CsdlTarget`.

## Notes ##

This release delivers OData core libraries including ODataLib, EdmLib and Spatial. OData Client for .NET is not  published in this release.
