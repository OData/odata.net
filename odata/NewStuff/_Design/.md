TODO work on "post" for clr
TODO write a bit of the clr sample
TODO write a bit of the context sample
TODO go to the protocol level
TODO what about error conditions?



TODO is there something at the CLR level that can expose the whole "metadata"? something like `graphroot` that can have a `.users` that is of the correct `user` type, and so on?
