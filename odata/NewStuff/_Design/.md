TODO write a bit of the context sample
TODO work on "post" for clr
TODO work on "patch" for clr
TODO go to the protocol level
TODO what about error conditions?


TODO at the protocol level could be an AGS implementation that puts the "users" from several workloads into a single collection



TODO is there something at the CLR level that can expose the whole "metadata"? something like `graphroot` that can have a `.users` that is of the correct `user` type, and so on?
