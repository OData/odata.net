1. customer
2. workload
3. ags
4. graphclient
5. odataclient



TODO go to the protocol level
TODO go to the convention level
TODO address todos within the code
TODO what is some generic value-add at each level that you can implement to demonstrate the utility of modeling in that level?
TODO probably _3_context should be about `idatastore`
TODO what about error conditions?
TODO at what point does an instance of the edm model come into play?


TODO at the protocol level could be an AGS implementation that puts the "users" from several workloads into a single collection



TODO is there something at the CLR level that can expose the whole "metadata"? something like `graphroot` that can have a `.users` that is of the correct `user` type, and so on?
