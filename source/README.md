ALL DECISIONS SHOULD REFER TO THE STANDARD!
PERSONAS: WORKLOAD OWNER, REVIEWER, AGGREGATOR, CLIENT


implement cast segments, implement csdl parser, then do an api review version; then do write operations; at this point, show it to reviewers; get query options from christof somewhere along the way


move code from epm to peachy
end to end tests should use an odata instead of an http client
update epm endtoendtests to actually implement odata along the way, things like @odata.type, @odata.context, etc
do code quality for peachy, endtoendtests, and iodata


add xml doc + warnings + todos + configureawait everywhere + other code quality stuff
increase test coverage

more epm apis
factor api review sample parsing and stuff frmo end to end tests into a shared library for other workloads to use

do you want an epm.peachyinteractionlibrary?
webapiepm
webapiepm.tests
peacy+aspnet epm
