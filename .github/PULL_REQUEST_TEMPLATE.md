### Repository notes

Team members can start a CI build by adding a comment with the text `/AzurePipelines run` to a PR. A bot may respond indicating that there is no pipeline associated with the pull request. This can be ignored if the build is triggered.

Team members should **not** trigger a build this way for pull requests coming from forked repositories. They should instead trigger the build manually by setting the "branch" to `refs/pull/{prId}/merge` where `{prId}` is the ID of the PR.
