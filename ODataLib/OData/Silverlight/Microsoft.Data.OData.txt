The segment '{0}' must be the last segment in the URI because it is one of the following: $batch, $value, $metadata, a collection property, a named media resource, a service operation that does not return a value, or a service action.
RequestUriProcessor_LinkSegmentMustBeFollowedByEntitySegment=The request URI is not valid. The segment '{0}' must refer to a navigation property since the previous segment identifier is '{1}'.
RequestUriProcessor_MissingSegmentAfterLink=The request URI is not valid. There must a segment specified after the '{0}' segment and the segment must refer to a entity resource.
RequestUriProcessor_CountNotSupported=The request URI is not valid, $count cannot be applied to the segment '{0}' since $count can only follow a resource segment.
RequestUriProcessor_CannotQuerySingletons=The request URI is not valid, since the segment '{0}' refers to a singleton, and the segment '{1}' can only follow a resource collection.
RequestUriProcessor_CannotQueryCollections=The request URI is not valid. Since the segment '{0}' refers to a collection, this must be the last segment in the request URI. All intermediate segments must refer to a single resource.
RequestUriProcessor_SegmentDoesNotSupportKeyPredicates=The request URI is not valid. The segment '{0}' cannot include key predicates, however it may end with empty parenthesis.
RequestUriProcessor_ValueSegmentAfterScalarPropertySegment=The segment '{1}' in the request URI is not valid. The segment '{0}' refers to a primitive property, function, or service operation, so the only supported value from the next segment is '$value'.
RequestUriProcessor_InvalidTypeIdentifier_UnrelatedType=The type '{0}' specified in the URI is neither a base type nor a sub-type of the previously-specified type '{1}'.
ResourceType_ComplexTypeCannotBeOpen=Complex types can not be marked as 'Open'. Error occurred for type '{0}'.
BadRequest_ValuesCannotBeReturnedForSpatialTypes=$value must not be specified for spatial values.
OpenNavigationPropertiesNotSupportedOnOpenTypes=Open navigation properties are not supported on OpenTypes. Property name: '{0}'.
BadRequest_ResourceCanBeCrossReferencedOnlyForBindOperation=Error processing request stream. In batch mode, a resource can be cross-referenced only for bind/unbind operations. 
DataServiceConfiguration_ResponseVersionIsBiggerThanProtocolVersion=The response requires that version {0} of the protocol be used, but the MaxProtocolVersion of the data service is set to {1}.
BadRequest_KeyCountMismatch=The number of keys specified in the URI does not match number of key properties for the resource '{0}'.
RequestUriProcessor_KeysMustBeNamed=Segments with multiple key values must specify them in 'name=value' form.
RequestUriProcessor_ResourceNotFound=Resource not found for the segment '{0}'.
RequestUriProcessor_BatchedActionOnEntityCreatedInSameChangeset=Batched service action '{0}' cannot be invoked because it was bound to an entity created in the same changeset.
RequestUriProcessor_IEnumerableServiceOperationsCannotBeFurtherComposed=Resource Not Found - '{0}' refers to a service operation or function which does not allow further composition.
RequestUriProcessor_Forbidden=Forbidden
RequestUriProcessor_OperationSegmentBoundToANonEntityType=Found an operation bound to a non-entity type.
